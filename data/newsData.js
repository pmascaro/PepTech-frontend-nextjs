            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
            <p>Sharing with you my continued journey to wellbeing and self-discovery is important for me.</p>

            <h4>What's <a href="https://uk.movember.com">Movember</a>?</h4>
            <p>Movember is an initiative that I hold dear. It's a global movement focused on men's health, aiming to raise awareness and funds for issues like
               mental health, as well as prostate or testicular cancer. Movember is more than just growing a moustache; it's about igniting crucial conversations 
               and taking action towards a healthier future for men.</p>

            <h4>Why I support Movember?</h4>
            <p>I started to actively support Movember in 2022, as it aligns with my life's principle of 'starting with WHY'. 
              It's not just about advocating for health externally; it's also about internal exploration and understanding our wider life purpose. </p>

            <h4>Attending UK Men's Retreat:</h4>
            <p>This December 2023, I will be attending a Men's Retreat, a significant step on my path to self-discovery. 
              The retreat is an opportunity to pause, reflect, and connect deeper with other men who are facing similar challenges. 
              My intention is to continue to uncover my genuine passions and values as I become, every day, closer to my true self.</p>

            <h4>How could you support me?</h4>
            <p>As I embark on this journey, I invite you to join me in supporting Movember. Your contributions will help fund life-saving research 
              and support programmes. You can donate to my Movember campaign  <a href="https://uk.movember.com/mospace/14529308">here</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <u> Thanks in advance for your donation, that means a lot to me: big or small, any help makes a significant difference.</u>
